# PythEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine in Python)

![Project Logo](image-1.png) <!-- Add your project logo here -->

PythEVM is an open-source implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in Python. It allows developers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute smart contracts using a Python-based environment. This project aims to provide an accessible and versatile platform for Ethereum development and experimentation.

## Features

- **Ethereum Compatibility:** PythEVM strives to maintain compatibility with the Ethereum protocol, enabling developers to work with familiar tools and standards.
- **Pythonic Interface:** With PythEVM, developers can write and interact with smart contracts using Python syntax and libraries.
- **Extensible:** The modular architecture of PythEVM allows for easy extensibility, enabling the addition of custom features and optimizations.
- **Test Environment:** A built-in test environment facilitates the development and testing of smart contracts without interacting with the live Ethereum network.
- **MIT License:** PythEVM is open-source and released under the permissive MIT License.
